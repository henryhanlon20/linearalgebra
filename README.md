# linearalgebra
This repository is a collection of assignments completed for ME300A: "Linear Algebra with Application to Engineering Computations" at Stanford University. These assignments demonstrate, test or evaluate various concepts of linear alegebra. 


Evalues-Evectors-Computation:

This script demonstrates the use of the power method and QR method for determining eigenvalue(s) and eigenvector(s) when computing the matrix's characteristic polynomial is impracticable. The script is presented in the frame of modal analysis of a building, using a simple mass-spring equation of motion to define the system.

Numerical Analysis:

This script uses least squares and newton-raphson to separately generate fit/regressions for the Michaelis-Menten Equation and Lineweaver-Burk Linearization, based off randomly generated data.

Solving Ax=b using Gaussian Elimation and Iterative Solvers:

In this script, we are examining 2D heat conduction via a rectangular plate. We solve for the solution (temperature distribution) in each finite element using Gaussian elimination, the Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel Method and Successive Over-Relaxation and compare the results.
